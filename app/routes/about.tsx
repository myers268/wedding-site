          <p>
            It all began with a setup by our good friend Roman, who knew us
            separately but thought we might be a good match. One cold January
            morning, we met for a casual coffee at Bayou Bakery… and ended up
            talking until late afternoon. A few memorable dates followed (ice
            skating, pizza and jazz, more ice cream than we care to admit, and
            several rounds of We're Not Really Strangers), and by the time the
            cherry blossoms began to bloom, so did we.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first year was full of adventures—hometown visits, camping
            trips, spontaneous getaways—and yes, more ice cream. But as the next
            spring rolled in, so did some storms. We hit pause on our story,
            leaning heavily on our friends (our unsung heroes) to help us
            navigate the space in-between.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            After some time apart—and a lot of prayer—we found ourselves back at
            a familiar table, sharing coffee and some honest words. That
            conversation reopened the door. Slowly, intentionally, we began
            again. The summer and fall that followed felt like a fresh breeze:
            full of hope, laughter, and late-night talks about our dreams for
            the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time the cherry blossoms returned once more, Zack knew: there
            was no one else he wanted by his side.

          <p>
            Our path hasn't always been linear, but it's been real, rooted, and
            full of grace. Like the blossoms that mark each turning point in our
            story, love came back—soft, strong, and in full bloom.

              This is Jaylee. We go waaaay back because she's my sister and
              first ever friend. We used to get into all kinds of trouble (just
              ask her about the time she put nail polish on my tongue while we
              were playing doctor). You can count on her to find the best
              restaurant in any city, host the cutest themed party, and tell you
              anything you need to know about teeth (she's a dental hygienist).
              She lives in our hometown of Longview, Washington with two really
              cute pups and her boyfriend Max.

              This is Anna. Our moms met at a garage sale before we were born
              and quickly decided that their babies would be friends and well,
              the rest is history. We've been through every big and little
              moment together, from ghost hunting in old houses to backpacking
              through the mountains of SaPa, Vietnam. She is the kind of friend
              who will have you laughing and crying and feeling inspired all in
              the same conversation. She lives with her wife, Phoebe, in Mt.
              Vernon, Washington.

              This is Abbey. We met through mutual friends and eventually became
              roommates in Big Blue (IYKYK). We love gabbing by the pool in the
              summer, and catching up on her couch while Survivor or Sports play
              in the background. One of my favorite moments together was walking
              around Lake Como while sharing dreams of our future. She lives in
              Washington, D.C. with her husband, Roman (who set Zack and I up!).

              This is Abigail. We met at church but really became friends after
              bonding over our mutual love for the Lumineers and working at
              coffee shops. Out of the many places we've been together, one of
              my favorites was a clifside cafe in Tangier where we sipped
              Morroccan mint tea and talked about our future dreams. She lives
              in Washington, D.C.

              This is Esther. She was my first roommate and built-in friend in
              D.C. (we literally shared a room). We bonded over long walks and
              fancy stay-at-home dinners during COVID, and even got to travel to
              New York, Virginia Beach, and Oklahoma together once the world
              opened up again. She is the best baker and sweetest dinner party
              host I know. She lives in Austin, Texas with her husband Andrew,
              and has a sweet lil one year old.

              This is Carinna. We met on our first night in college at Azusa
              Pacific University and decided to live together every year after
              that. Some of my favorite moments together were driving to the
              beach after class to catch the sunset, sneaking into Disneyland
              for free, and watching New Girl on the comfiest couch you can
              imagine. She lives in Carlsbad, California and just got married to
              her husband, Bryce, in October.

              This is Hayley. We met through our weekly Sunday night dinner club
              and would often get lunch once a week while she was in school
              since it was blocks from my office. She's listened to me laugh,
              cry, and always has something incredibly thoughtful to share. She
              lives in Arlington, Virgina with her husband Chris and their cute
              new puppy.

              This is Madison. We first met over FaceTime, but then for real
              when I went home with Zack for Thanksgiving. She lives in Kokomo,
              Indiana and has a cute pup named Moo.
